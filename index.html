                    <h3>"Let Me Introduce Myself"</h3>
                    <p>My name is Aryan Samaria.I am from Rajasthan and I recently graduated from Arya college of engineering and IT , Jaipur Rajasthan. I have completed my degree in Artificial intelligence and Data science with the aggregate of 8 CGPA. And in my college time I developed my interest in ML and Data science which led me to work on my college major project where our team has developed hand sign recognition CNN model and we have deployed the model on website using flask.So while working on the Development aspect of my project I discovered a passion for python full stack development and to further serve my skills here I am pursuing python full stack development course from Jspiders Marathalli. And as I was the leader of our project team and also the captain of our college basketball team it has equipped me with strong leadership skills and ability to handle pressure efficiently.
                        I am excited about the future opportunities and to bring my technical skills and leadership skills to various python innovativeÂ projects.</p>

                        and deaf individuals practice sign language with ease. Using a CNN model, the site recognizes 31 hand signs (A-Z and 5 words). Flask powers the backend, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript make the frontend interactive. Plus, the live camera feed lets users practice in real time, so they can nail their hand signs right on the spot. This project combines tech with accessibility, making communication more inclusive and fun!</div>

School in Jaipur, where we got a chance to interact with deaf and mute students through their teacher. When we showed them our hand sign recognition model, their reactions were priceless! They were super excited about the technology and loved how it could help them practice and improve their skills. It was amazing to see their enthusiasm and happiness, knowing our project could really make a difference in their learning journey.</div>
